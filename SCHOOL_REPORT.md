# Problem Statement:

Design a conversational AI agent to assist users in retrieving relevant information from a previously provided context.

## Design Overview:

To address this problem, I leveraged the LangChain framework in combination to develop a novel conversational AI agent.
 The agent will utilize a combination of general and specialized language models, along with vector databases, 
 to effectively understand user queries and provide relevant responses based on previously loaded contexts.

## Components of the Solution:

### LangChain Framework: 

LangChain provides a robust framework for building and deploying language models and vector databases.
 LangChain is utilized to orchestrate the integration of various components of our conversational AI agent.

### Large Language Models (LLMs):

A large language models like GPT-3.5 is used to understand and generate natural language responses. These models will
 be fine-tuned on conversational data to enhance their performance in understanding user queries.

### Vector Databases (Pinecone): 

Pinecone will be used as the vector database to store and retrieve the context as vectors. This will enable efficient
 generation of accurate responses.

## Design Details:

### User Interaction:

Users interact with the conversational AI agent via the command-line interface. They provide their queries as 
 command-line arguments along with optional the previous chat history.

### Input Processing:

The command-line tool processes user inputs and passes them to the LangChain backend for further processing.

### Context Retrieval:

If a previously loaded context is provided, LangChain retrieves relevant vectors from the Pinecone vector database.

### Question Answering:

The LangChain framework utilizes the combination of large language models and previously loaded context (if available)
 to generate responses to user queries.

### Response Presentation:

The AI-generated responses are presented to the user via the command-line interface.

## Outcome:

By implementing this solution, users will have access to a command-line tool-based conversational AI agent capable of 
 effectively retrieving relevant information from previously loaded contexts. This agent streamlines the process of 
 accessing information and provides a convenient interface for users to interact with the AI-powered system. 
 It serves as a valuable tool for various applications requiring contextual understanding and information retrieval.
